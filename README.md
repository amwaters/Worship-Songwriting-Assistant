## Known Issues

+ There's only a macro-structural connection between lyrics and chords, it'd be nice to nudge the model to add more micro-structure.
+ I haven't tested if the IPA transcription *actually* improves results
+ Rhythm and stress analysis might also help (if I can get it working; GPT4 is *terrible* at syllables)
+ Do the sharps and flats look a little weird to you?
+ Further discussion and feedback on [implementing Songwriting Ethics](https://github.com/amwaters/Worship-Songwriting-Assistant/issues/1) is welcome!
