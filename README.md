- Tell me more about your process and capabilities.
- Write a worship song based on Psalm 23.
- Write an upbeat song about freedom and forgiveness.

## Known Issues

+ There's only a macro-structural connection between lyrics and chords, it'd be nice to nudge the model to add more micro-structure.
+ IPA, rhythm and stress analysis might also help (if I can get it working; GPT4 is *terrible* at syllables)
+ Do the sharps and flats look a little weird to you?
