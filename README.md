## Conversation Starters

- Write a simple heartfelt song about peace.

## Known Issues

+ There's only a macro-structural connection between lyrics and chords, it'd be nice to nudge the model to add more micro-structure.
+ I haven't tested if the IPA transcription *actually* improves results
+ Rhythm and stress analysis might also help (if I can get it working; GPT4 is *terrible* at syllables)
+ Do the sharps and flats look a little weird to you?
